# AutoStreamML
## Overview

AutoStreamML is an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline built using Streamlit, Pandas Profiling, and PyCaret. It provides a user-friendly interface for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, all within a single application.

With AutoStreamML, you can easily analyze your dataset, generate exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports, compare multiple machine learning models, fine-tune hyperparameters, and deploy the best-performing model with just a few clicks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, AutoStreamML simplifies the entire machine learning workflow and empowers you to build powerful models with ease.
